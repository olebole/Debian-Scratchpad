Description: Fedora Astronomy Spin
 Here we list the packages that belong to the 
 [Fedora Astronomy Spin](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Astronomy_Spin).

Depends: cdsclient
Homepage: http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/doc/cdsclient.html
Pkg-Description: Tools to query databases at CDS
 The cdsclient package is a set of C and shell routines which can be built on
 Unix stations or PCs running Linux, which once compiled allow to query some
 databases located at CDS or on mirrors over the network.

Depends: saoimage
Homepage: http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/saoimage.html
Pkg-Description: The original, needs 8bit Xserver
 SAOimage (pronounced S-A-0-image) is a utility for displaying astronomical
 images in the X11 window environment. It was written at the Smithsonian
 Astrophysical Observatory by Mike Van Hilst in 1990 and hass been maintained
 by Doug Mink. Image files can be read directly, or image data may be passed
 through a named pipe (Unix) or a mailbox (VMS) from IRAF display
 tasks. SAOimage provides a large selection of options for zooming, panning,
 scaling, coloring, pixel readback, display blinking, and region
 specification. User interactions are generally performed with the
 mouse. Mouse tracking in an image's world coordinate system, usually sky
 coordinates, was added in 1994. You can also plot catalogs over images with
 WCS information in their headers.
 .
 The SAOimage desktop includes, a main image display window, a button menu
 panel, a display magnifier, a pan and zoom reference image, and a color
 bar. A color table graph window can be brought up by clicking on the color
 bar.

Depends: skyviewer
Homepage: http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/toolbox/tb_skyviewer_ov.cfm
Pkg-Description: Program to display HEALPix-based skymaps in FITS files
 SkyViewer is an OpenGL based program to display HEALPix-based skymaps, saved
 in FITS format files. The loaded skymaps can be viewed either on a 3D sphere
 or as a Mollweide projection. In either case, realtime panning and zooming
 are supported, along with rotations for the 3D sphere view, assuming you have
 a strong enough graphics card.

Depends: indi-plugins
Remark:
 The Debian package includes the plugins that are separate packages on Fedora:
 indi-sx, indi-gphoto, indi-eqmod, indi-apogee, indi-aagcloudwatcher

Depends: indi-bin

Depends: kstars

Depends: skychart
Homepage: http://www.ap-i.net/skychart
Pkg-Description: Planetarium software for the advanced amateur astronomer
 This program enables you to draw sky charts, making use of the data in 16
 catalogs of stars and nebulae. In addition the position of planets, asteroids
 and comets are shown.
 .
 The purpose of this program is to prepare different sky maps for a particular
 observation. A large number of parameters help you to choose specifically or
 automatically which catalogs to use, the colour and the dimension of stars
 and nebulae, the representation of planets, the display of labels and
 coordinate grids, the superposition of pictures, the condition of visibility
 and more. All these features make this celestial atlas more complete than a
 conventional planetarium.

Pkg-Description: Astronomical Tables in Python
 ATpy is a high-level Python package providing a way to manipulate tables of
 astronomical data in a uniform way. It provides built-in support for NumPy
 recarrays and common astronomical file/database formats (FITS, VO, HDF5, and
 ASCII tables) with a very simple API.

Pkg-Description: General tools for Astronomical Time Series in Python
 Gatspy contains efficient, well-documented implementations of several common
 routines for Astronomical time series analysis, including the Lomb-Scargle
 periodogram, the Supersmoother method, and others.

Pkg-Description: Astronomical source extraction and photometry in Python
 SEP makes available some of the astronomical source extraction and photometry
 algorithms in Source Extractor as stand-alone functions and classes. These
 operate directly on in-memory numpy arrays (no FITS files, configuration
 files, etc). Itâ€™s derived directly from (and tested against) the Source
 Extractor code base.
