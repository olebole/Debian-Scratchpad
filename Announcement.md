    Subject: Announcing a Debian Astro Pure Blend

Hi,

After our blends package was accepted, and we got our logo, I would like to
officially announce the new "Debian Astro" Pure Blend.

Debian Astro is a spin-off from the Debian Science Pure Blend with the goal to
support both professional and amateur astronomers.

Infrastructure
==============

We created a mailing list [1] for discussions about astronomy related topics
for users as well as for developers.

An Alioth project [2] was set up for team maintenance of our packages. We use
git for package maintenance [3].

Blends Tasks
============

These tasks will be available to ease the installation of Debian Astro:

 * Catalogs
 * Data Reduction
 * Education
 * Publication
 * Simulation
 * Telescope Control
 * Tools
 * Viewers
 * Frameworks
 * Python
 * Python3
 * Tcl/Tk
 * GDL
 * Development

A description of the tasks as well as the package lists for each task are
available from the Blends web sentinel [4], which can be also reached from the
Debian Astro Blend home page [5].

[5] http://blends.debian.org/astro/

Status
======

Currently, we have ~75 source packages in team maintenance. The total number
of packages in the Blends Tasks lists is >200. Packages include
state-of-the-art analysis frameworks like Astropy, but also important legacy
packages. Our goal is to deliver the first version of the Blend together with
the release of Debian Stretch.

Sprint
======

We plan to have a Debian Astro Sprint in late summer this year in Germany and
would like to invite all interested to join us.

Thanks
======

We would specifically thank Andreas Tille who helped a lot setting up the
blend, and Maria Hammerstr√∏m who created our nice logo.
